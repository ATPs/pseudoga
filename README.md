# pseudoga
Cell pseudotime reconstruction based on genetic algorithm

The package pseudoga can be used to perform pseudotime analysis on single
cell gene expression data. Given a homogeneous population of cells, the cells can be ordered
to form a trajectory. Given a heterogeneous population and cell cluster ids, the packages
can be used to find a tree structure based on pseudotime ordering of cells.
